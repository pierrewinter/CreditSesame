# Credit Card Default ðŸ’³
Predict the likelihood of default for credit card clients

## Overview
In this repository I have built 3 predictive models which predict the likelihood of default in the following month. I have used open-source data from the UCI Machine Learning repo which can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients#). This data contains 30,000 rows of Taiwanese customer data from 2005. I use this data to engineer new predictive features, cross-validate model hyperparameters, and evaluate metrics for the final models.

## Notebook
Details of the business problem, code for the model development, and summary of the business value can all be found in the Jupyter notebook file [credit_default_prediction.ipynb](credit_default_prediction.ipynb).
